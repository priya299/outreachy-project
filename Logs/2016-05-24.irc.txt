[2016-05-24 15:05:42] <priya_> hi jesus
[2016-05-24 15:06:15] <jgbarah> BTW, if you use my screen name (jgbarah) when you write, I will hear an alarm, and can come to the channeñ
[2016-05-24 15:06:38] <jgbarah> That´ s why I'm using priya_ instead of Priya, just in case you have it configured that way too ;-)
[2016-05-24 15:06:47] <priya_> ok jgbarah :)
[2016-05-24 15:06:50] <jgbarah> I know you're a bit in a hurry, so let's go
[2016-05-24 15:06:51] <jgbarah> ;-)
[2016-05-24 15:07:00] <jgbarah> I guess you were with the tests, right?
[2016-05-24 15:07:17] <priya_> No its ok... Till 4 I'm free :)
[2016-05-24 15:07:25] <jgbarah> ok
[2016-05-24 15:07:31] <priya_> yes... with the tests part
[2016-05-24 15:08:10] <jgbarah> You're working with the unnittest package?
[2016-05-24 15:08:13] <jgbarah> Any problem?
[2016-05-24 15:08:48] <priya_> small problems happening... no I'll finish it off soon... in between my system got crashed... but now its ok
[2016-05-24 15:09:36] <priya_> I'll complete it soon.... If getting stuck with some other major issues, will let you know... I guess I can complete it
[2016-05-24 15:10:13] <jgbarah> ok. Just in case, maybe you can enjoy reading http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/
[2016-05-24 15:10:42] <jgbarah> For the tests, in addition to testing the functions by calling them, it would be great if you use a sample mbox...
[2016-05-24 15:10:55] <jgbarah> ...and test that the software threads messages well.
[2016-05-24 15:11:03] <priya_> yes I'm using a sample mbox.... 
[2016-05-24 15:11:12] <priya_> ok
[2016-05-24 15:11:17] <jgbarah> ok, perfect. Just waiting to see it working ;-)
[2016-05-24 15:11:29] <priya_> hehe..ok :)
[2016-05-24 15:11:43] <jgbarah> Let me comment a bit on the general structure of the job.
[2016-05-24 15:11:51] <priya_> yeah ok
[2016-05-24 15:12:19] <jgbarah> On one hand, you have to use Perceval to get the metainformation for some mboxes.
[2016-05-24 15:12:43] <jgbarah> Then, use Perceval as well for getting metainformation from commit records in git repositories
[2016-05-24 15:12:56] <priya_> okay
[2016-05-24 15:13:03] <jgbarah> Then, thread the metainformation about messages, and match threads to commits
[2016-05-24 15:13:31] <jgbarah> For this, we will try a couple of options, probably starting with matching the subject in the thread to the first line of the commit comment
[2016-05-24 15:14:02] <priya_> oh ok
[2016-05-24 15:14:19] <jgbarah> Once the matching is complete, it will be a matter of producing a combined set of information, with the thread id, the commit hash, and some info about both the thread and the commit
[2016-05-24 15:14:31] <jgbarah> eg, the thread subject, time-span, participants,
[2016-05-24 15:14:39] <jgbarah> and the commit author, date, length...
[2016-05-24 15:14:51] <jgbarah> For storage we will use ElasticSearch
[2016-05-24 15:15:00] <priya_> yeah ok
[2016-05-24 15:15:25] <jgbarah> That is, when using Perceval, we will upload the raw information to ElasticSearch, and then when the combined info is produced, we will uploard it to Elasticsearch too
[2016-05-24 15:15:41] <jgbarah> And finall, we will produce a dashboard for Kibana
[2016-05-24 15:16:28] <jgbarah> Similar to https://kibana.bitergia.com/xen
[2016-05-24 15:16:38] <priya_> combined info is all the details which u had mentioned like time-span, participants all those things?
[2016-05-24 15:16:46] <jgbarah> Are you already familiar with ElasticSearch / Kibana ?
[2016-05-24 15:17:30] <jgbarah> Yes, in technical terms, combined info will be one or more ElasticSearch indexes, with information about matched commits and threads, that will be used to produce the dashboard
[2016-05-24 15:17:44] <priya_> No, I just went through it. What it is about and all... Not much
[2016-05-24 15:17:47] <priya_> ok
[2016-05-24 15:18:10] <jgbarah> ok, Then we could use this schedule for the first weeks:
[2016-05-24 15:18:33] <priya_> ok jgbarah. That would be fine :)
[2016-05-24 15:19:18] <jgbarah> (1) You set up an ElasticSearch and a Kibana instance and start playing (instructions for download are at https://www.elastic.co/products
[2016-05-24 15:19:33] <jgbarah> (2) You finish the tests for the mbox thing
[2016-05-24 15:19:41] <priya_> yeah ok
[2016-05-24 15:20:08] <jgbarah> (3) You upload the Perceval raw info and the threading info to ElasticSearch. For this, you can use the elasticsearch.py package
[2016-05-24 15:20:24] <priya_> ok
[2016-05-24 15:20:35] <jgbarah> (4) You get familiar with getting commits from git repos with Perceval, and again upload them to elasticsearch
[2016-05-24 15:20:48] <jgbarah> Once we're there, we will have advanced a lot ;-)
[2016-05-24 15:20:55] → _acs_ joined (~acs@253.red-83-39-97.dynamicip.rima-tde.net)
[2016-05-24 15:20:58] <priya_> oh nice :)
[2016-05-24 15:21:19] <jgbarah> I guess all of these could go in parallel, but if you prefer we can sequence them in this order (1) (2) (3) (4)
[2016-05-24 15:21:29] <jgbarah> Does that sounds like a plan?
[2016-05-24 15:21:41] <priya_> yes 
[2016-05-24 15:21:52] <priya_> fine fine :)
[2016-05-24 15:22:14] <jgbarah> For elasticsearch.py, you can browse https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html
[2016-05-24 15:22:45] <priya_> yeah ok
[2016-05-24 15:23:01] <jgbarah> Please notice thare is elasticsearch_dsl.py as well, which is higher level. But for this, probably we won't need it.
[2016-05-24 15:23:22] <priya_> oh ok
[2016-05-24 15:23:26] <jgbarah> Once you have ElasticSearch installed, it would be easy to test it with elasticsearch.py
[2016-05-24 15:23:42] <priya_> ok 
[2016-05-24 15:23:58] <jgbarah> Maybe this could have you fed until our next meeting, on Wed. next week?
[2016-05-24 15:24:29] <priya_> yeh fine
[2016-05-24 15:24:36] <priya_> Wed same time?
[2016-05-24 15:24:47] <jgbarah> Hi, lars_kurth, I hadn't noticed you there!!
[2016-05-24 15:24:53] <jgbarah> Yes, Wed same time
[2016-05-24 15:25:00] <priya_> ok
[2016-05-24 15:25:13] <jgbarah> For now, you can go onn working in your repo. At some point we will start to pr GrimoireLab repos
[2016-05-24 15:25:14] <priya_> Hello lars_kurth
[2016-05-24 15:25:25] <jgbarah> So, inn summary, try to:
[2016-05-24 15:25:28] <priya_> oh ok
[2016-05-24 15:25:54] <jgbarah> (1) Have a working deployment of ElasticSearch and Kibana. Try it at least a bit, try to produce a dashboard with the demo data for example
[2016-05-24 15:26:06] <jgbarah> (2) Produce the tests for the trheading code
[2016-05-24 15:26:47] <priya_> yeah okay
[2016-05-24 15:26:49] <jgbarah> (3) Write a script that uploads both the raw Perceval output on an mbox, and the threading info, to ElasticSearch
[2016-05-24 15:27:52] <jgbarah> For this, you can just upload a new index to ElasticSearch with all the info in the raw Perceval index, plus the fileds you may need to tag each message with its corresponding thread (probably one field).
[2016-05-24 15:28:17] <jgbarah> (4) Write a script that uploads the Perceval output on a git repo to ElasticSearch
[2016-05-24 15:29:06] <jgbarah> (5) Only if you have time, and are in the mood, try to produuce a simple dashboard for either the gti or the mbox info (or both ;-) ) in Kibana
[2016-05-24 15:29:16] <jgbarah> Do you find this reasonable?
[2016-05-24 15:29:47] <jgbarah> ( lars_kurth seems to be away ;-) )
[2016-05-24 15:29:54] <priya_> yes :)
[2016-05-24 15:29:59] <jgbarah> ok, perfect.
[2016-05-24 15:30:22] <jgbarah> I will try to hangout here as much as possible. Send me an email message if you're stuck with anything, or need some more info.
[2016-05-24 15:30:43] <priya_> yeah sure.. Thank you
[2016-05-24 15:30:55] <jgbarah> To begin with, try to use this plan to produce a message, and probably a blog post (a kind of plan for starting the project)
[2016-05-24 15:31:21] <priya_> oh ok
[2016-05-24 15:31:45] <jgbarah> Just to organize things a bit, you can save logs of our irc conversations in your repository, and maybe link them from your blog posts
[2016-05-24 15:32:03] <priya_> yeah ok
[2016-05-24 15:32:23] <jgbarah> Say you can open a repository such as "outreachy-project", or something like that, open a directory, and wrtie files with the logs in it,
[2016-05-24 15:32:52] <jgbarah> for example, this one could be 2016-05-24.irc
[2016-05-24 15:33:11] <priya_> ohh ok
[2016-05-24 15:33:36] <jgbarah> And in that same repository, you could open like five issues, one for each of the topics above.
[2016-05-24 15:33:53] <priya_> ohhh ok... got it :)
[2016-05-24 15:34:20] <jgbarah> As you work on them, you can update the ticket. Let me and lars_kurth be a part of the repo, and we will comment on the tickets as well, if nneeded
[2016-05-24 15:34:34] <priya_> okay
[2016-05-24 15:35:21] <jgbarah> Those will be your progress and scheduling tickets, probably later we will have GrimoireLab tickets as well.
[2016-05-24 15:35:29] <jgbarah> And....
[2016-05-24 15:35:31] <priya_> ok
[2016-05-24 15:35:37] <jgbarah> ....I guess this is all from my side for now...
[2016-05-24 15:35:46] <jgbarah> Anything else from your side?
[2016-05-24 15:36:03] <priya_> ok Thanks for the detailed info jgbarah
[2016-05-24 15:36:10] <jgbarah> Thanks a lot to you!
[2016-05-24 15:36:38] <priya_> :) 
[2016-05-24 15:36:46] <jgbarah> TAlk to you next Wed, or earlier. Please note that on Monday and Tuesday probably I won't be available, although I'll try
[2016-05-24 15:37:07] <jgbarah> This was our first meeting ;-)
[2016-05-24 15:37:20] <priya_> ok... Will meet you next week... 
[2016-05-24 15:37:26] <priya_> yeah :)
[2016-05-24 15:38:57] <jgbarah> Have a nice week
[2016-05-24 15:39:17] <priya_> Thank you and same to you :)
